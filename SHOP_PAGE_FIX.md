# 🔧 Shop Page Fix - Issue Resolution Summary

## ❌ **Problem Identified**
The shop page was showing "Loading products..." and console errors because of a **hardcoded API endpoint** in the inline JavaScript.

### Root Cause:
In `shop.html`, there was a direct fetch call:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/products?limit=100'); // ❌ Wrong - goes to Netlify
```

This was making requests to `https://hotimpex.netlify.app/api/products` instead of the Railway backend.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Updated the fetch call to use the proper API configuration:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_CONFIG.getApiUrl()}/products?limit=100`); // ✅ Correct - goes to Railway
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**
- **API Config**: ✅ Correctly points to Railway
- **Railway API**: ✅ Returns valid JSON with products
- **CORS Headers**: ✅ Properly configured
- **Frontend Fix**: ✅ Now uses correct API URL

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**
Now when users visit https://hotimpex.netlify.app/shop.html:
1. ✅ Products will load from Railway backend
2. ✅ CORS will work properly  
3. ✅ No more "SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'"
4. ✅ Products grid will display correctly

## 🔄 **Files Modified**
- `public/shop.html` - Fixed inline fetch call to use API_CONFIG
- Removed temporary `cors-debug.js` script

## 🚀 **Status**
**RESOLVED** - The shop page should now work correctly with the deployed Railway backend!
